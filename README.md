# htmlcallout

An Experimental HTML binding approach with pluggable actions that can manipulation html elements directly.

Designed to have html elements bind to actions. Each action is called upon to manipulate the calling element. I'm trying to see if I can make a flexible templating system with easy to use & create bindings.
